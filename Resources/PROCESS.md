#PROCESS

Since I was working alone in making this website I had to learn to schedule different times to work on separate sections of the site. Once I knew what I wanted to do I started coming up with the questions and then moved on to the whatever else I could start on. After I was done with the bones of the site I went back to answer the questions. Once I've  answered everything I plan to go back and make the site look nice.

# Big-Data-Project
Author-Yesenia P.

This is the data comparison of how many people search up tattoos vs plastic surgery over a period of 14 years. 

I choose this area to researcher because I feel like tattoos and plastic surgery are still considered taboo today. I hope to show that there are many people searching these up and therefore they should be more normalizes. I am also fascinated by tattoos and their different styles and feel like plastic surgery is sometimes viewed negatively like tattoos are.

# Investigation

First I feel like it's important to understand what tattoos and plastic surgery are before understanding the reasons for these questions. Then comes the obvious question of "Which one is more popular?" Internet search wise. Lastly I incorporated some commonly asked questions like "Why do people get them?" This I feel is always the first question asked to a person who has these body modifications.


Because of the accessibility to google trends it was relatively easy to determine a pattern within the data. Mostly being because the data was already transformed into a graph without needing to filter out anything. In order to be more specific I did need to focus on the data of one specific year. This forced me to do some independant research and convert the data to a graph. I was able to creat this graph by using a free graph make.

# Explanation of Peer Review

Since I was working alone in making this website I had to learn to schedule different times to work on separate sections of the site. Once I knew what I wanted to do I started coming up with the questions and then moved on to whatever else I could start on. After I was done with the bones of the site I went back to answer the questions. Once everything was answered I went back to make the overall site look nice.

This is the data comparison of how many people search up tattoos vs plastic surgery over a period of 14 years. 

I choose this area to researcher because I feel like tattoos and plastic surgery are still considered taboo today. I hope to show that there are many people searching these up and therefore they should be more normalizes. I am also fascinated by tattoos and their different styles and feel like plastic surgery is sometimes viewed negatively like tattoos are.

Then comes the obvious question of "Which one is more popular?" Internet search wise. Lastly I incorporated some commonly asked questions like "Why do people get them?" This I feel is always the first question asked to a person who has these body modifications.
